# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis.
An interactive html page and Java Script are utilized in this analysis to display data on UFO sightings in the USA. The page reads from a JS file containing the relevant information and presents it in a table that can be filtered using five different input options.

### Purpose
The purpose is to understand and learn how to create a interactive HTML page using Java Script.

## Results:
The final result is an a clear and neat page that display UFO sighting data.

## Summary:

### Drawback of this webpage.
This webpage looks fairly tidy, but there are still some areas for improvement. One issue is that it is not immediately clear that the table is updated automatically. Some users may be expecting a button labeled "Filter" or "See Results" and could be confused by the current design. One problem also is that data only contains USA events.

### Additional recommendations for further development
It would be useful to allow searches to be filtered by the duration of the UFO sighting by dividing the time entries into categories.

We can improve this page by considering splitting the entry results into multiple pages. As the number of entries grows, the page could become difficult to navigate due to excessive scrolling. Additionally, adding a button that allows the user to select the number of results displayed per page (e.g., 25, 50, 100) could enhance the user experience.
